# Quiz-App Specification Document

## 1. Introduction:
   - **Objective of the Document:** This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of a Quiz App using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and Tailwind for styling.
   - **Project Context:** The project involves creating a web application with authentication, basic informational pages, an admin section, and a user section for quiz management.
   - **Stakeholders and Their Roles:**
     - **Project Developer (YOUNES MOUSTAQUIM):** Responsible for the entire development process.
     - **End Users:** Individuals who will be accessing and using the Quiz App.
     - **Admin Users:** Individuals with administrative privileges for managing quizzes.

## 2. Project Overview:
   - **General Description:** The Quiz App aims to provide a platform for users to take quizzes on various topics. It includes authentication, basic information pages, and an admin section for managing quizzes.
   - **Goals and Objectives:** Develop a fully functional Quiz App with user authentication, quiz creation, and management capabilities.

## 3. Context:
   - **Environment:** The Quiz App will be implemented using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and Tailwind for styling.
   - **Constraints and Dependencies:** No external project dependencies; however, the development is constrained by a three-week timeline.
